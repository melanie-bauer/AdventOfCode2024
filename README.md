# Advent of Code 2024 🎄  

Welcome to my **Advent of Code 2024** repository!  
This is where I document my solutions to the daily programming puzzles from [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2024).  

## My Unique Challenge 🌟  
For this year, I’ve added an extra layer of difficulty to the challenge:  
I aim to solve as many puzzles as possible using **minimal lines of code** and heavily utilizing **LINQ** (Language Integrated Query) in C#.  

### Why does the code look weird sometimes? 🤔  
You might notice that some of the solutions look strange, convoluted, or not like “typical” clean code. That’s because I’ve prioritized:  
- Writing solutions in as few lines as possible.  
- Experimenting with LINQ to push its boundaries, even in unconventional ways.  

While this might make the code less readable or maintainable, it’s all part of the fun and a personal learning experiment!
